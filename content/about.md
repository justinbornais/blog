Hello, I'm Justin! I am a full-stack web developer with experience in Next JS 13.0, React and Flask. I also have experience with other languages such as C, C++, Python and Java.

Along with being a computer scientist, I am also a piano teacher, pianist and guitarist. I have been playing the piano since I was 5 years old, the guitar since I was 14, and I have been teaching since age 15. Additionally, I have played at numerous funerals and weddings over the past 2 years. I am passionate about music and sharing that joy and creativity with others. You can check out my music website [here](https://bornaismusic.ca/).
